The input files are First_Aerodynamics which uses "trimmed_CL_CD.txt" as input and contains
a function which returns the CL and CD values given a Mach number and angle of attack,
as well as some inter- and extra polation parameters

First_propulsion is used to compute propulsion system performance (Constant mass flow,
varying thrust)

First_mass_geometry provides mass and geometry of the first stage

These files should be in the same directory as First_stage_ascent_functions and simulation

In Simulation:
I don't see where you would need to modify anything to run the code

In First_stage_ascent_functions:
I also do not see where you should modify anything to make simulation run as long
as all files are in the same directory. Apologies if I missed something

Summary of the relevant lines:
Simulation: line 123 - 233 (Custom functions: 168 - 203)
First_stage_ascent_functions: line 148 - 274 and 277 - 371
